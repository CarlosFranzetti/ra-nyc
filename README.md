# 🌃 RA NYC Events Browser

**Your backstage pass to New York City's underground.**

A Vite + React + TypeScript SPA that displays Resident Advisor events for New York City. Data is fetched from RA's GraphQL API via a Supabase Edge Function (Deno), which acts as a proxy to avoid CORS issues and implement rate limiting.

## ✨ What's This?

Ever wish you could browse all the hottest techno, house, and electronic music events in NYC without clicking through a million tabs? Yeah, us too. This is just a scraper that pulls event data from Resident Advisor and displays it in a clean, fast interface.

** No fluff. No BS. Just the lineup, the venue, and the vibes. ** 🎶
